[administration]
# Set the IDMA administrator group.
# This group is purely for system administrators of the IDMA system and not for use in consumer systems of the IDMA
# system.  It is highly recommended to customize this value to avoid CRIME.
#
# This is deliberately set here as a fail-safe mechanism.  In the event of a system compromise, change this value and
# restart the service.
#
# The group specified here will not be seeded in your IDMA instance.  You must use the seeder utility in 'exec/' to
# seed it.
#
# You will also need to use the seeder to inject your first admin user after changing this value.
